## Rates / Bonds


+ CLO and CDO's Return (June)

CLOs have come back into the limelight for the epitome of bad investing, 245
of the CLOs were holding some portion of Hertz, J. Crew and Neiman Marcus debt.
Those three companies have filed for bankruptcy protection. Despite this bad
behavior what has been more alarming is the government's unmitigated/
unwavering commitment to bolster the market instead of allowing bad businesses
to fail. CLO's I don't believe are to blame they sell risky debt to investors
who salivate for higher returns - who also understand the consequences, safer
aspects of the debt become triple A rated, and many who work in the industry
say they didn't default during 08' and are unlikely to default now. But what
is different now is that the Private Equity buyouts have doubled in numbers and
the leveraged debt market has doubled. What the key takeaway is that with CLOs
being at risk it means the next rounds of buyouts by PE firms will be harder to
back with funds and they have traditionally been the sources of capital. So,
PE firms will have source new capital.


+ Canada Notched Down (June)

Fitch ratings notched Canada's triple A rating down due to their financial
measures to deploy capital into the economy, as a result they owe roughly 12%
of their GDP. Correspondingly, fitch notched their rating down. This most likely
won't have a meaningful impact on the cost of borrowing, as Canada is a pretty
safe haven for investors and it has not seemed to show a sharp spike in their
yield.


###. Inflation on the Horizon? (June)

What is most important to recognize during this time of the Federal Reserves
programs such as the CARE act and the legislation that was passed to deploy
funds to support businesses might have serious ramifications for inflation in
the economy. Inflation being an oversupply of money - prices rising in the
economy. It hasn't happened yet, but with guaranteed loans through by the
government and bolstering of corporations who need relief is not going to bode
well in the long run. More and more companies are coming online who will be
propped up through artificial rates. The likelihood of the government clawing
back debts is not likely - we spend superfluously and there appears to be no
end in sight. With rates already at zero, the only option is to keep issuing
loans.


### Bond Market Supported by Fed (June)

The Federal Reserve will begin bolstering the corporate bond market -
investment grade debt through index funds, while also providing backstops to
continue any additional funding needed by the corporations. This comes as a
bit of an odd placement as the Federal Reserve is running out of avenues to
provide financial support to the economy. I am not quite sure why they are
supporting businesses through this way, because to some extent they need to
stop holding the hands of all the businesses. It is like pruning, it may be
quite a pain right now but it will make for better outcomes in the long run.


+ Fed's Ninth Debt Facility (June)

This is the Fed's 9th debt facility which was opened this past Monday -
totaling $500 Billion to support issuance of new debt by large corporations.
The Fed will participate in two ways, it will purchase eligible loans and bonds
next to investors and also act as the sole investors. The last option which is
almost like a bailout - said those bonds would have a capped spread.
Furthermore, companies that were investment grade prior to March 22nd, would be
eligible.

In total, the Fed has amassed $8.7 billion in debt or ETFs that invest in
corporate debt to provide liquidity to the market and reduce borrowing costs
to now troubled investors. In relation to government debt, yields have stayed
near lows, as investors flock into these safe assets due to the growing
number of Covid-19 cases.

+ Mortgage Market Tightens (June)

Politician's are calling for the pausing of key debt repayments to mortgage
lenders as hotels, shopping malls has been struggling to make payments due to
the lockdown of the economy. A data point provided by the Wall Street Journal
said 'some 7.15% of CMBS loans were 30 or more days delinquent at the end of
May, including 19% of hotel loans and 10% of retail loans, according to data
from Trepp.' While it is not said in this article, but these were two
industries that had disruption this decade - particularly from e-commerce
giants Amazon and hotel alternatives such as AirBnB.



### Rates Near Zero to 2022 (June)

The Federal reserve signaled to investors that they plan to keeps rates
steady through 2022. This statement was backed by Powell discussing that
they are 'not even thinking about raising rates'. The Fed is going to keep
to keep pace with buying mortgages and securities. Recall, that the Fed has
purchased so far $2 trillion treasuries and mortgages since Covid-19 started
to provide liquidity - this is different from past measures which were used to
primarily push down long-term rates, the Fed is instead focusing on providing
smooth markets.

The main confusion is how the Fed is going to communicate their guidance in the
coming years. Typically this is known as 'forward guidance', but the Federal
Reserve is not sure how they will do this, whether it be inflation targeting, or
through tying it to certain dates, and buying as needed to reinforce that rate.
They will keep this guidance vague as it is not clear when markets will recover
likely to recover when a vaccine is commercialized.


+ Conflicting Data (June)

Investors are still trying to grapple with the data that is coming in about
markets. While retail sales were up and manufacturing data was contracting at
a slower pace than anticipated - indicating we may be bottoming out. However,
Covid-19 cases are still rising. As a result treasuries are trading in a
narrow range. Additionally, the economy needs to see jobless data show
improvement, as recovery money stops on July 31st the labor market needs to be
materially better or we'll hit a deeper low. JPM analysts expect unemployment
to stay at 10% or above till the year end. JPM also expects issuances of Fed
monies of 4.8 trillion, net of treasuries. Furthermore, the S&P, NASDAQ and
Dow Jones have told very different stories. The NASDAQ has done quite well
mainly fueled by technology, but the Dow Jones has done much worse.


+ Yield Shows Pessimism (June)

The yield ended at .698 on the 10-year, showing people's pessimism in the market,
this is further backed by the Federal Reserve's commitment to have rates stay
steady through 2022. The yield has stayed stagnant - this yield is what is used
to gauge everything from student loans, to mortgages. The Federal Reserve is
going to stay committed (what is believed by most) so that borrowing costs can
stay low for businesses and allow the economy to breath. We did see the yield rise
last week - which was based on the data that the economy is adding jobs which
was not expected.

After initially leaning on short-term Treasury bills to fund the trillions of
dollars in economic-relief programs passed by Congress, the Treasury Department
in early May announced a shift to longer-term bond sales, increasing the size of
regular 10-year note auctions by $5 billion and 30-year bond auctions by $3
billion.

Supply pressures have further been exacerbated by a deluge of bond sales from
companies looking to stock up on cash as they try to weather the economic
downturn. Nonfinancial companies have sold more than $650 billion of investment-
grade bonds in the U.S. market since the start of March, shattering previous
issuance records, according to Dealogic.

Some analysts argue that longer-term Treasury prices could still drop sharply
again if economic data improves - as that would show that the long-term outlook
is looking much more promising and that investors would buy those safe bonds at
a discount.



+ Euro Junk Debt Rallies (June)

Recently the European High-Yield debt has begun to rally as investors are
seeking outsized returns to combat current market conditions. This is been a
similar trend in the United States, with junk debt rallying so investors can
chase higher returns. The spread (recall this is the extra yield over
government securities), for Europe was 4.69, and the U.S. it is 5.69. This
shows two different tales, Europe has not rushed to get cash, while U.S.
companies have rushed for cash pushing yields higher, Europe's have remained
more conservative.

This rationale is backed by central bank policies. ECB has not made it as much
of a priority to support 'fallen angels', while the Federal Reserve has made it
a much more apparent goal to support these companies and their issuances. With
respect to U.S. markets, there has been more robust and promising data to
support companies with poor credit. Interesting point, is S&P projects the
corporate default rate could rise to 8.5%, up from 2.4% in March. Furthermore,
it should be noted that cash is piling up in Europe as investors braced for a
prolonged crisis, so any high-yield issuances would be well-received.


+ Economy Savings Changing (June)

It was stated by Powell that the economy was going to reach a point where
it was going to feel long lasting changes by Covid-19. I am not so sure if it
is so much because of the pandemic or more so by the Federal Reserve's
meddling with economy. The personal savings rate has reached 33% in the U.S
and for the Euro-Zone it is up to 19%. We've seen high flows into money-market
funds by domestic investors and foreign investors we've seen flooding into
dollar denominated assets. Another article I read discussed that the stimulus
checks sent out by the government when it stops (July 31st) will dramatically
make the economy buckle. I am not sure how widespread that effect will be, at
some point the government has to stop printing money and providing funding and
open the economy back up.

### Fed may Mimic YCC Policies (July)

The Fed is toying with an idea of capping yields on government bonds, but this
move needs to be heavily weighed as medium yields are an important benchmark
for the rest of the investing world. Meddling/artificially messing with the
rates set could distort the market mechanisms.

But part of this is seen as a way for the Fed to finally to rid the debt by
inducing inflation and growth, inflation helping to get rid of debt. This
strategy is seen as a way for investors to get out of government bonds and
focus on investing in the market. But inflation cannot seem to get off the
ground.

This is especially important following the news of investors seeking higher
returns through the municipal market. It seems that if YCC policies were to
ensue markets may price higher yields in order to satisfy investors appetite.

## Deals


### IPOs

+ Virtual IPOs - Big Benefits (July)

Virtual IPOs have become something that isn't to be dreaded but enjoyed by
bankers and management. While it seemed initially that it would make life more
challenging, it has come with bright spots; less time traveling on road shows,
condensed investor meetings virtually, no management presentations slides to be
printed, less fees charged for travels and management celebrating with family.
This does not mean things are more easy to time markets - with data coming in
that seems to gaslight investors, it is just one small bright spot in this mess.


+ Lemonade to go Public (June)

Insurance startup lemonade is set to go public later this year, the fintech
insurance company is valued at around 1.43 billion. They are looking to shake
the insurance company by eliminating brokers and providing claims in under 3
minutes. GS, Barclays and MS are the underwriters.

+ Postmates IPO Revives (June)

Postmates has revived plans for an IPO following Covid, as stay at home meal
orders have surged. It has received a lot of interest such as M&A interest
from Uber. This comes after Just Eat Takeaway proposed a $6 billion of Grubhub
to create a trans-atlantic giant. Postmates was last valued at $2.4 Billion
when it raised $225 million in September. Instacart doubled its valuation to
$13.7 billion


### Bankruptcy Filings

+ GNC Files for Bankruptcy (June)

Tuesday night GNC filed for Bankruptcy, planning to close between 800 - 1200
stores. It plans to be either sold, or shed $300 million of its debt load.

+ Chesapeake Files Chapter 11 (June)

Chesapeake energy filed for Chapter 11 on Sunday, their strategy is aimed at
cutting off $7 Billion in Debt and raise $600 million rights offering, they
are able to draw upon $325 million from Chapter 11 financing to cover expenses.
This list adds to others who have filed for Bankruptcy such as Hertz, JC Penny,
Chuck E. Cheese and GNC.

+ Chinese Energy Co Defaults (June)

A Chinese energy company defaulted today, this is just the latest in a
string of companies defaulting and it is of no surprise it was an energy
company. The company was Hilong Holding Co.

#### Wirecard's Fall (June)

After a 2 billion dollar accounting hole was found in WireCard's books their
share price has plummeted and their CEO was arrested. The big takeaway from
this scandal is that countries try to keep a light touch with regulation as
they hope that a given company if given space it can become the next billion
dollar unicorn such as Amazon or Google. What turns into a light touch, appears
that Germany became more of a cheerleader. As a result, WireCard had a massive
scandal. It should be a message to the broader investor base about fintech, that
one should use caution. In Germany's case they banned short-selling the stock
and filed complaints against those who defamed it.

+ WireCard NA for Sale (June)

Wirecard North America has put itself up for sale, after the troubled parent
firm filed for insolvency, the unit was formely known as Citi Prepaid Card
Services.

### Investments


+ Toyota Invested in Uber (June)

Toyota has a $293 Million stake in Uber, they own roughly .6% of the
outstanding shares of Uber.

+ Dailmer to Sell French Plant (July)

Dailmer - owner of Mercedes and Smart is putting its plant up for sale in
France, they decided to move operations to China, France pleaded for them to
stay but it does not look like they will.

The signal here is that China still remains a hub for manufacturing and
luxury car makers must look to cut costs in order to stay afloat.

+ Apple makes its own Chips (June)

Apple announced they will start making their own computer chips for its Macs and
iPads, they typically in the past have used Intel's x86 chip. Apple's R&D
expenses are some of the highest in the world but analysts believe it is two
years or so till they can have a fully functioning chip. Apple is working to
improve its ARM chip which is used in smartphones, but intel's x86 has been
always seen as superior. Finally, Apple only accounts for less than 5% of
Intel's revenue so this is not a massive blow to Intel.

+ Virgin Signs w/ Spirit Aero (June)

Virgin airlines signs a manufacturing deal for its hyperloop plans with Spirit
AeroSystems holding. This news is important because Spirit is shifting away
from Boeing, they typically make their money through supplying Boeing. Virgin
airlines is expected to be up by 2029, and they have raised most of their
money from UAE.

### Private Equity

+ PE is Approved for 401k (June)

Interestingly enough PE was approved to be used in 401k plans. Typically, PE
has been used for pension plans but before it wasn't used in 401k target date
funds. This comes as a huge win for PE as they have been trying to tap the 7.9
trillion dollar market for 401k retirement packages. Partners Group and
Pantheon Ventures were the two firms that introduced 401k plans to investors.
Still there are logistical issues to hurdle - such as how they can still have
lock-up periods, but the main one is, can PE returns still outperform S&P and
other metrics in a meaningful way? It appears they can only outperform by a bit.





## Oil



### Oil Shoots up (June)

During the Covid-19 lockdown the price of oil fell to historic lows, but now
as the economy seems to be thawing out from a freeze, it is shooting up. But it
appears to be shooting up because investors are looking to cash in, other risky
assets such as stocks are shooting up at a sort of unfounded optimism. Supply is
high and demand is low, the fundamentals are not founded, but prices appear to be
be pushed up. OPEC and Russia did agree to cut production by 9.7 million barrels
a day to help stabalize price which I am sure helped investors ease their
confidence a bit more. Inventories are still rising, once they begin to decline,
I would imagine investors optimism will finally be founded.


+ Oil Refiners Squeezed (June)

The domestic benchmark for oil prices are U.S. crude-oil prices such as WTI and
the international standard is Brent-crude futures. Due to the odd shift in
demand and supply where prices are rising but demand being slammed, it put
refiners in a very odd position. As they were buying crude at higher prices
but they had no market to sell in. Refiners will be in a bad position as they
still have swollen inventories and no need to buy oil. If the pain was pin-
pointed it would be in Northwest Europe and Mediterranean who run on Russian
crude, Urals which is the main grade of exported by Russia has shot up
because of Russia's participation in supply cuts.

+ Oil Crushes Investors (July)

Investment services have spent years making oil products easy for investors
to use and trade with, however, these products were not designed to encompass
the markets unpredictability. When oil futures moved to negative, investor
platforms could not handle the issue. Many investors who were holding futures
which if not sold, must take the delivery of the oil. But when prices slid to
be negative, investors were not able to sell the futures and were stuck to
take the losses. Many investors were not able to offload the product because of
the platforms, but this does not go without saying that many research reports
were indicating that oil could go negative. Investors were warned.

The broader implication of this event is that regulators will need to examine
commodity trading among ordinary investors and make more stringent policies in
how trading works in these areas.

+ Oil Tankers Seized, Strained OPEC (July)

Oil tankers were seized that were headed to Venezuela from Iran, this is due to
efforts from the United States to follow through with its embargo and financial
strains it is imposing on Iran and its commitment to oust the Venezuelan
regime. It was able to seize a fleet of tankers and stop payments to the
Royal Guard.

Additionally, strains seem to be highly apparent between OPEC members as
Nigeria and Angola have yet to submit plans to show how to cut oil prices,
oil prices took a massive dive earlier this year after a price war between
Russia and Saudi Arabia ensued. If there is a price war again, and this time
it would mostly effect China, as Angola and Nigeria produce a very light crude
that is desirable in China global prices would be effected greatly.

### Electricity in Texas (June)

Being a power producer of electricity in Texas is a great position to be in,
Texas has been on an upward trend over the last few years - this is
accompanied by a growing population base. What is most bizarre about this
market is that electricity demand is set to fall to the lowest point in years.
Despite oil and gas's weak figures, they do tap into the grid and the numbers
for drilling are quite down - yet the market is still on pace to grow.

What is most interesting is that Texas has a very free-market approach to its
power system. Most other states follow strict guidelines and have very rigid,
artificial market structures to keep pricing below a certain threshold. Part
of their open market approach means that they have an operating margin, where
if supply falls below a certain level, prices become higher.


### Possible Iran Sabotage (July)

Iran claimed there might have been possible sabotage after several facilities
sustained explosions, specifically at Natanz which is where their key
uranium-enrichment facility is, the week prior, a blast hit a ministry defense
facility. This comes at a time when the U.S. is at an economic war with Iran.
Furthermore, the rest of the world is trying to cool off their nuclear efforts
mainly due to their deep-seated issue against U.S. ally, Israel.

Tensions have been high since Trump withdrew from the 2015 nuclear deal and
imposed tough sanctions on Iran in 2018. But the blasts come at a time when
there is not much faith in their government after they 'had a plane shot down'
but later to find it way the Royal Guard's fault.

The broader thing to takeaway is that tensions are high, and something needs to
give soon as Iran is being backed into a corner economically.


## Political

+ India Bans TikTok (June)

After a clash at the disputed himilayan border with China that left 20
Indian soldiers dead, Prime Minister Modi banned TikTok and WeChat - a move to
help answer domestic cries to retaliate towards China. The big financial
implication of this move - is that India is considered one of the biggest
untapped markets for tech companies. Google has tried 'India first' approaches
where their Maps app has an option for rickshaws and will buzz when there is
deviation from the path. Additionally, India has warned firms of working with
Chinese companies to install 5G infrastructure.

Furthermore, India has become a battleground between the U.S. and China, where
the United States - where the U.S. has been calling for allies to shun
Chinese technology especially from Huawei. Additionally, the U.S. has been
weighing if TikTok poses a national security threat - though I doubt they could
garner enough support to ban it, as popular as it is with younger generations.
But a bill was posed to ban TikTok from government issued phones to federal
employees so that there could be no 'data leaks'.


+ Bezos Willing to Testify (June)

Jeff Bezos is willing to testify in front of Congress alongside other tech
leaders regarding anti-trust procedures. This is following the news that
Amazon employees had used sensitive third-party business information to develop
competing products on its platform. Essentially they had an unfair advantage
over others and used its marketplace role to abuse others. Amazon has fired
back saying their products account for less than 4% and they follow all rules.

Bezos frequents Washington - as he owns the Washington Post and Amazon
frequently contracts with the government. Amazon did lose out on the 10 billion
dollar cloud computing contract with the pentagon last year to Microsoft. Other
companies that will be testifying are Apple, Alphabet and Facebook.


+ North Korea blows up Office (June)

The North Korean regime blew up a liaison office that was jointly used by
the South Koreans. It was a push back after anti-establishment leaflets made
its way across the border. This comes after they have stated they continue
to bolster their nuclear arms - they even said their relationship with the U.S
has worsened. Furthermore, Trump was the first president to meet with Kim,
so if he is not re-elected it may mean worse tensions. They do risk upsetting
Russia and China, their only allies



+ Potential New Tariffs (June)

The U.S. said it could impose new tariffs on U.K., France, Germany and Spain
over disputes over subsidies to aircraft manufacturers, namely Airbus SE.
It would total upwards of $7.5 billion, namely, chocolate, coffee, olives,
vodka, gin, beer and potatoes. Part of this story is that a better trade deal
with the EU has remained elusive, trade team of the White House has commented
that it does not look good in the short run, for the trade tensions between
the U.S. and the EU. The targeting of foodstuffs is meant to culturally effect
the EU, even though this dispute is over aircraft manufacturing.

## Financials

+ Banks Warned Before Outbreak (June)

Prior to the rapid spread of Covid-19, Dr. Farrar warned money managers and
banks of the Covid-19 situation. Covid had started to spread, but Farrar told
money managers such as Valiant Capital, the Blackstone Group and others of how
dynamic this disease could be. Farrar has advised the U.K and Germany of
infectious diseases. Apparently they had released other public statements to
understand the 'science' behind the disease. The call occurred on January 31st
of this year.

+ World's Best Big Lender, DB (June)

Despite the troubles Deutsche has been going through, it is the best lending
bank on record. Investors shouldn't become too bullish on the bank just yet.
The Federal Reserve recently hit them with weak money-laundering controls, and
they were at all time lows with Covid and their troubled past. The bank has
been trying to stick to its plan under Sewing, which is to cut costs, limit
risky asset exposure, and limit U.S. exposure. It is noteworthy that at least
they never took a part of the bailout.

Many were skeptics of Sewing, as they did not believe he could cut 18,000 jobs
by 2022 and they were ready to write him off after a failed merger with
Commerzbank Ag. They did transfer their prime brokerage business to BNP Paribas
last year. Its core business has been focused on Germany - which has been
overbanked and thus unprofitable. But they have been disposing of risky assets
at a very fast rate which makes investors more comfortable with the company.
But Germany has been spending a great deal to keep businesses afloat, and it
has relatively fewer cases than other countries - which means overall Germany
is expected to recover faster than others.

+ Probes Against Exchange Data (June)

Big banks and other financial industry experts have been complaining against
about the fees that are charged by exchange services such as NYSE, NASDAQ and
CBOE. From 2014 to 2017 total annual revenue from market-data surged 45% to
$2.3 billion, the big data providers say that if the firms do not wish to pay
for the data they can use public data feeds which are much slower and contain
less data. So, the SEC and the U.S Justice Department will team up and provide
much more scrutiny over the data providers.


## Data


### Covid Data

+ Covid Cases Surge (June)

Coronavirus infections have surged in states such as Arizona, Texas and
California. California's governor said they may start enforcing stricter
social distancing policies to help quell the number of new cases.

### Jobs Report

+ Jobs Rebound, Gloomy August Ahead (July)

The job report that came out showed jobs were added 11.1 million and the rate
fell to 11.1% from 13.7%. This is a positive sign and it is ending the week on
a much better note - but data analytics from Johns Hopkins and JPM show that
as jobs are added and local spending increases it is becoming a predictor of
new cases in the U.S, and high contact job rate falls so do Covid cases. It
appears that there is a trade-off to be had, and while jobs may be added we are
seeing that cases are soaring, but states are clamping down on re-opening
efforts with New York and New Jersey post-poning indoor dining indefinitely.

### Retail Data

+ Sales Rise by 18% (June)

Surprisingly good news was that retail sales had jumped up 18%, most of this
appears to be stemming from pent up savings of consumers. This was after 3
months of declines in sales in stores. But many believe there will be a fading
of the stimulus checks quickly before the panic is over.
